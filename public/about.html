<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a 27-year-old freelance web developer and a proud member of the Army, having enlisted
  in 2023. Since joining, I've never looked back, and my journey has sparked a love for learning new skills. Creativity has always been a core part of who I am. From a young age, I've been passionate about creating things and calling them art. I believe imagination is one of the most valuable assets, and I bring that sense of creativity into the world of web development. 
  <br />
  Outside of coding, I'm deeply passionate about football and fitness. Running and working out are daily habits that keep me grounded and motivated. These activities teach me the importance of discipline and perseverance-values I carry over into my work. If you'd asked me a few years ago who I wanted to be, I might have struggled to answer. But now, I've discovered a strong drive to create, design, and build websites from the ground up, and I'm excited to share my skills and vision with the world.
